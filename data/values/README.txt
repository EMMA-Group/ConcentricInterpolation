filename scheme:
D   = dimension of Euclidean space, i.e. for points on the d-sphere: D=d+1
N   = number of points. "from" indicates that the first half of the directions
      were created using a symmetrized kernel function, and the other half
      consists of the antipodes.
s   = case index: -2 means LOG, -1 means log, >0 means Riesz
EQ  = Equal Area points
R   = number of equally spaced radii from 0 to 1 along each of the N directions

storage format:
.txt: tab and space separated numbers, N-by-R entries

example:
D8_N512from256_s-2_R5.txt
   contains the function values at the 5 radii 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 along the
   512 directions that were generated by symmetrizing 256 LOG-optimal points
