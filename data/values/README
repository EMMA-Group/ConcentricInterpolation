filename scheme:
D   = dimension of Euclidean space, i.e. for points on the d-sphere: D=d+1
N   = number of points. "from" indicates that the first half of the directions
      were created using a symmetrized kernel function, and the other half
      consists of the corresponding antipodes
s   = s-index of the kernel that was used for the creation of the hyperspherical
      minimum energy points to which the values of this file correspond:
      -2 means LOG, -1 means log, > 0 means Riesz
EQ  = Equal Area points
R   = number of radii from 0 to 1 along each of the N directions given by the
      minimum energy points on the unit hypersphere

storage format:
.txt: tab and space separated numbers, N-by-(R*DimValues) entries

example:
D8_N512from256_s-2_R5.txt
   contains the function values at 5 radii along the 512 directions that were
   generated by symmetrizing 256 points that minimize the symmetric LOG-energy
   on the 7-sphere
