filename scheme:
D   = dimension of Euclidean space, i.e. for points on the d-sphere: D=d+1
N   = number of points
sym = symmetry flag: 1 means symmetrized kernel was used, 0 means usual kernel
      was used
s   = s-index of the kernel that was used for the creation of these
      hyperspherical minimum energy points: -2 means LOG, -1 means log,
      > 0 means Riesz
EQ  = Equal Area points

storage format:
.txt: tab and space separated numbers, N-by-D entries

example:
D4_N512_sym0_s-2.txt
   Contains 512 rows, each with 4 columns, consisting of the coordinates of 512
   LOG-optimal points on the 3-sphere, without the use of symmetrization of the
   LOG-kernel
